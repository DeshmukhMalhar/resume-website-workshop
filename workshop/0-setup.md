# Setup

As you might expect, the first step to getting started with any new technology is obtaining a couple of tools. But the magic of this workshop is that you won't need anything more than a web browser. That's right - no install, which means you can do this practically anywhere. This workshop was built on an iPad.

You _will_ need a GitHub account, which is free. Click here to get a free account if you don't already have one.

## Creat a GitHub repository

We'll start by creating a new GitHub Repository. A repository is a place to store your code. You can think of it like a folder in the cloud for your project files.

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/new)
1. Enter "resume" as the repository name
1. Make sure to mark it as "Public"
1. Under "Initialize this repository with click "Add a README file"

This will create a new GitHub repository called "resume" with a single file in it called "README.MD". The "README.MD" file is used to describe the project. It's the first thing people will see if they visit your repo. It generally contains information about how to install, setup and run the project.

## Open the project in github.dev

GitHub has a built-in code editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code). You can open your repository in the editor by pressing the "." key on your keyboard when you are on the main repository screen. Alternatively, you can change "github.com" to github.dev". For instance, if your repository URL is "https://github.com/ataridotcom/resume", you would change that to "https://github.dev/ataridotcom/resume".

This will open your project in VS Code.

## Install CodeSwing

Once you have your repository open in github.dev, we'll install CodeSwing. CodeSwing is an extension which helps us create HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and see updates in realtime.

1. Open the Extensions toolbar by selecting **View** > **Extensions**
1. In the **Search Extensions** textbox in the upper-right corner, type **CodeSwing**
1. Select **Install** for **CodeSwing**

The extension will be installed.

## Summary and next step

Congratulations! You have the tools you need to begin creating HTML/CSS pages. Next, let's [create our first page](./1-create-html.md).
